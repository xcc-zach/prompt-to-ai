Describe what each file does under this project. Include file paths and brief descriptions. For the brief description of each file, use `summarize-file` skill with argument `path/to/file`. Ignore `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `.env`, project config files like `requirements.txt` or `Cargo.toml`, files in `docs/` and build artifacts. The files should be listed in the order of importance. After listing all files, provide a short summary of the overall project purpose and functionality. Then provide instructions on how to read through the codebase effectively (start from which file, then to which file/directory, then to ...).

Output example:
```markdown
