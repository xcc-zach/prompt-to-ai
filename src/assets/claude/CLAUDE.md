Always use English when writing code comments and commit messages.
When committing, start commit messages with a type prefix followed by a colon and a space, then a concise description of the change. Use the following type prefixes as appropriate:
- feat: for new features
- fix: for bug fixes
- docs: for documentation changes
- style: for code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- refactor: for code restructuring without changing behavior
- perf: for performance improvements
- test: for adding or modifying tests
